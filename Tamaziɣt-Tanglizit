Algeria's 2020 Constitution, promulgated on December 30, 2020, following a referendum, represents a significant constitutional revision aiming to address the demands of the "Hirak" popular protest movement and reshape the nation's governance. Initiated by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, the constitution seeks to establish a "New Republic" by introducing reforms across various branches of government and reinforcing fundamental rights. Key provisions include strengthening the separation of powers and judicial independence, notably by replacing the Constitutional Council with a Constitutional Court. It reinforces parliamentary oversight, including allowing for a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister or Head of Government. The constitution also maintains a two-term limit for the presidency, clarifying that it applies to both consecutive and non-consecutive terms. While aiming to bolster citizens' rights and freedoms, including constitutionalizing the National Independent Electoral Authority (ANIE) to enhance electoral integrity. The preamble notably references the Hirak movement, acknowledging its role in the demand for reforms. This constitution is seen as a governmental response to popular calls for greater transparency, accountability, and a more robust democratic framework.
