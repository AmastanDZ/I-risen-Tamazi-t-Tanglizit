The Algerian Agency for Investment Promotion, is the key governmental body in Algeria responsible for attracting and facilitating investment within the country. Operating as a public administrative institution under the direct authority of the Prime Minister, AAPI serves as a centralized "one-stop shop" for both domestic and foreign investors. Its core mission involves actively promoting diverse investment opportunities, particularly in strategic economic sectors, and providing comprehensive support to investors through streamlined administrative procedures, notably via its Digital Investor Platform. The agency is also tasked with granting various investment incentives, managing the allocation of economic land for projects, and continuously monitoring project implementation to ensure compliance and success. Essentially, AAPI is instrumental in driving Algeria's economic diversification efforts and fostering job creation in alignment with the nation's investment policies.
